// Question 30
// Assume that no programming language has a function for returning the result of one integer raised to the power of another integer. It has become very necessary for you to write a computer solution that can be used to calculate a^b  where a and b are integers. Note that a may also be a real number but b should always be an integer.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a, b, c;
    cout << "Enter the number: ";
    cin >> a;
    cout << "Enter the power: ";
    cin >> b;
    c = a;
    while (b > 1)
    {
        c = c * a;
        b--;
    }
    cout << "The result is: " << c;
    return 0;
}
