// Question 15
//  The  RUSSIAN  PEASANT  method is one way of finding the product of any two given numbers. Given that A and B are two positive numbers, A is divided by  2  and its decimal part truncated, while B  is also  multiplied  by 2.  This process of dividing and multiplying is repeated until A attains a value of 1. The product of the two numbers is then  the  sum  of  all  B values whose corresponding A values ( including the initial value of A) are odd. As a typical example, let A and B be 21 and 10 respectively then the division and the multiplication can be written down as follows:

// 	Current value of  A			Current value of B
// 21	                              10
// 10					              20
// 5					              40
// 2					              80
// 1					              160

// In the above, the bolded lines show when the value of A is odd. The product of the two numbers will therefore be the sum of the bolded B values, which is 210 (10+40+160). Write a computer solution that accepts as input two positive integers and then return the product of the two numbers using the above method with an appropriate caption. Hint use the modulus operator ( %) where necessary.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a, b, product;
    cout << "Enter the two numbers you want to find the product of; ";
    cout << "\n1st number: ";
    cin >> a;
    cout << "\n2nd number: ";
    cin >> b;
    product = 0;
    while (a != 0)
    {
        if (a % 2 != 0)
        {
            product = product + b;
        }
        a = a / 2;
        b = b * 2;
    }
    cout << "The product of the two numbers: " << product;
    return 0;
