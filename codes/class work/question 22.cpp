// Question 22
// Write a computer solution to generate the Fibonacci series given the first two terms. For example, if the first two terms of a series are 0 and 1, the next (3rd) term is obtained by adding the two preceding terms (1st and 2nd), etc. Thus the third term of the series will be 1 and the fourth will be 2, etc. Generally, the Fibonacci series is defined as follows:
// 		  Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 for i=3, 4, â€¦., n
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of terms: ";
    cin >> n;
    int a = 0;
    int b = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
        cout << c << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
